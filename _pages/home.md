I'm the top contributor on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297) for Python questions, ranked #5 overall and I was [elected â™¦ Community Moderator](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/291017/100297) in 2015. 

I have decades of experience with web applications, content management, database-driven applications, scalability, and data processing. I have worked in small consultancies, was an engineer at Facebook, and just about every size of company in between.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you feel I could help you with your project, too.
