Zopatista's personal site
-------------------------

My personal site, stripped down to something I'll actually maintain.

The projects folder only exists to support legacy URLs; the contents redirect
to pypi mostly, except for the python distribution files, for which proper
redirects would otherwise be too cumbersome to support.

Running locally
===============

Keep the local toolchain up-to-date with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bundle update

Run a local server to preview posts with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

For more info, see the `GitHub pages documentation`_.
