description: Listen to an interview with me on the Talk Python to Me podcast on the
  subject of Stack Overflow and, of course, Python.
---

I was interviewed for the excellent [*Talk Python to Me* podcast](https://talkpython.fm/), in [Episode #86](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/86/python-at-stackoverflow) on the subject of Stack Overflow, Python, and my connection to both!

> If you run into a problem with some API or Python code what do you do to solve it? I personally throw a few keywords into google, sometimes even before checking the full docs.
>
> Why does this work? Because invariably an excellent conversation and answer from StackOverflow comes back with just what I need.
>
> This week you'll meet Martijn Pieters. One of the top Python contributors at StackOverflow with over 16,500 questions answered and a reputation of over 500,000.
